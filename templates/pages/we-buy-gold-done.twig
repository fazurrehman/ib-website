          I was nervous to sell my Rolex from my family estate and I wanted a
          trusted buyer. Lots of places in Atlanta were offering me consignment
          and they didn’t seem trustworthy. Icebox was able to give me cash on
          the spot and I’m confident the offer was beyond fair. I really
          appreciate the service.

          There are lots of pawn shops in Atlanta but I didn’t want to sell my
          Rolex at a pawn shop. I called Icebox and they were very secure and

          Very honest company to do business with, hassle free. I actually sold
          both my Rolex watch here one in 2014 and another one in 2019. Both
          times they gave me the most because I shopped it around to make sure I
          got the most money. Jenee helped me in 2014 and in 2019 so thank you
          to Jenee.

          Best place to go for a gift on any occasion.. Customer service is always good and top notch at IceBox. No

          the budget they always have something that fits my needs. I have personally referred friends and family to
          IceBox and
          they leave out a happy customer.

          I often hear people say how Atlanta is a small city and that you run into people you know all over town or
          that everyone
          eats/shops at the same spots. I walked into this store about two weeks ago on my own without ever mentioning
          the name of
          the place to my husband. All he knew was that I saw some earrings and a Rolex that I liked. Well earlier this
          week, I
          saw our credit card statement and of all the stores in town, it showed that he got my Christmas gift from
